#new lib folder/class


new lib class


new cloud class
 feature:
 	- multiple eucalyptus cluster support
 	- amazon ec2 support 
 	- eucalyptus / amazon runs with boto (no more euca2ools)
 	- openstack (single, multiple account) supports


Mycloud class reads cloudservice_cloud_resources table and connects user's resources in that table.
I tested with 2 eucaluptus account (different clusters) and 1 amazon account. 
Communicating with these three different cloud resources works well.

Atmosphere can expand not only one eucalyptus cloud but also unlimited resource connections with Mycloud class library
