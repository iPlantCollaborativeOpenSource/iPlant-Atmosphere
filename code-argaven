argaven code chagnes

argaven does not use boto anymore. at least, I don't directly use boto or euca2ools directly. 
argaven code now use libcloud project library (http://libcloud.apache.org). 

argaven code is focused on rackspace / openstack resource controller. 

argaven code may or may not compatible with charoncode.
